# PY-CL-Dictionaries

## Overview
This project demonstrates various operations on dictionaries in Python. It includes functions to create dictionaries, manipulate dictionary elements, and retrieve information from dictionaries. The project also includes an entry point script (`app.py`) to interactively demonstrate the functionality, along with unit tests (`lab_test.py`) to ensure the correctness of the implemented functions.

## Files

### app.py
The `app.py` file serves as the main entry point for the project. It allows users to interactively test the dictionary manipulation functions implemented in `lab.py`. Users can create dictionaries, access elements, remove keys, and perform other dictionary operations through this script.

### lab.py
The `lab.py` file contains the implementations of various dictionary manipulation functions. Each function is documented with instructions on how to use it and what it does. The functions include creating dictionaries, clearing dictionaries, copying dictionaries, getting values for keys, retrieving items, keys, and values from dictionaries, and removing keys from dictionaries.

### lab_test.py
The `lab_test.py` file contains unit tests for the functions defined in `lab.py`. It ensures that the implemented functions behave as expected by testing them with various input cases. The tests cover scenarios such as dictionary creation, clearing dictionaries, copying dictionaries, getting values for keys, retrieving items, keys, and values, and removing keys from dictionaries.

    - app.py
    - lab.py
  - test/
    - lab_test.py

## Getting Started
1. Open the `src/main/app.py` file.
2. Run the `app.py` file to interactively test the dictionary manipulation functions.
3. Follow the prompts to create dictionaries, access elements, remove keys, and perform other dictionary operations.
4. Refer to the instructions provided in the docstrings of each function in `lab.py` for guidance on usage.

## Testing
1. Open the `src/test/lab_test.py` file.
2. Run the `lab_test.py` file to execute the unit tests.
3. Ensure that all tests pass, indicating that the implemented functions are working correctly.

## Conclusion
This project provides hands-on experience with dictionary manipulation in Python. By exploring the functions in `lab.py` and running the tests in `lab_test.py`, users can enhance their understanding of dictionaries and improve their Python programming skills.

Happy Coding!
